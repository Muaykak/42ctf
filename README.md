### What is 42CTF ?

Explanation from Gemini (11-2025)
>The term 42 CTF generally refers to a Capture The Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competition that is associated with the 42 school network, which focuses on peer-to-peer computer programming education.
>Here's a breakdown of what "42 CTF" encompasses:
>Capture The Flag (CTF): This is the competition format. In a CTF, participants (often called "hackers" or "players") are given a series of cybersecurity challenges or puzzles. The goal is to exploit vulnerabilities, reverse-engineer code, crack cryptography, or solve forensics problems to find hidden pieces of text called "flags." Submitting a flag earns points.
>42 Network: The competition is tied to or hosted by the global 42 school network (e.g., 42 Abu Dhabi, 42 Paris). These schools are known for their innovative, project-based learning model.
>Specific Events: "42 CTF" has been used to refer to several different events, including:
>42 CTF (Abu Dhabi): A major annual competition (powered by groups like RedTeam Hacker Academy) held in Abu Dhabi, often open to both students and professionals.
>42CTF.org Events (Paris/Internal): The website 42ctf.org hosts various smaller, internal, and external CTFs, such as "Welcome CTF," "Speed Dating CTF," and "Easter CTF," primarily targeting the 42 students in Paris but sometimes open to the public.
>In short, it is a cybersecurity challenge event designed to test and develop practical hacking and defense skills, strongly affiliated with the 42 school ecosystem.
